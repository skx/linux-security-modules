# whitelist

This is a LSM in which the kernel denies the execution of binaries
to non-root users, unless there is an extended-attribute named
`security.whitelisted` present upon the binary.

**NOTE**: The content/value of that attribute doesn't matter, only the existance is tested

There is some back-story in the following blog-post:

This module was enhanced in the [hashcheck LSM](../hashcheck/).
